        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of pasta, rich meat or vegetable sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese, and melted mozzarella, all baked to perfection. The combination of flavors and textures creates a hearty and comforting meal that is perfect for family dinners or special occasions. Traditionally, lasagna is prepared with a slow-cooked tomato-based sauce, often featuring ground beef or sausage, but variations with chicken, seafood, or even a vegetarian mix of spinach and mushrooms are also popular. Served hot with a side of garlic bread or a fresh salad, lasagna is a timeless favorite that brings warmth and satisfaction to every bite.
